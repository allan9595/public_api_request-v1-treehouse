This app calls an [API](https://randomuser.me/) and pulls random people's data back. You can search our employees based on their name from keyboard. When you click on the card, it will open a modal. You can toggle forward and back.

## Exceeding style changes
Changed modal and modal container's background. Card hover background updated. Body background updated. Search-submit background updated.
